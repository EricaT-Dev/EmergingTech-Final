                    AR, which stands for Augmented Reality, is a developing technology that has grown in popularity and scope over time. 
                    This technology collects information about the environment of the user and based on this information, overlays visuals on top through the lens of a screen. This screen can be on a device such as a phone, a tablet, or a headset.

                    The MIR headset implements the use of AR to bring tech into everyday life, no matter where you are. 
                    It allows individuals to connect online in a more easy and manageable manner, allowing them to still stay present and in the moment rather than get distracted by a device that takes their focus away from their surroundings.
                    Users can connect to any of their online information from the headset once they link their accounts.

                    The MIR is especially useful for busy people. It makes multitasking easier, as everything you need is contained on the screen rather than divided among several physical objects.
                    The headset can be used for school or work, visualization of products and designs, entertainment such as games or videos, and task guidance or assistance.
